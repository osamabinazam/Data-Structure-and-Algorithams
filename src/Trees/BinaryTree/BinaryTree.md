# Binary Tree
    A tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children
    Sinceeach element in a binary tree can have only 2 children,
    we typically name them the left and right child.

    Binary tree is a family of data structures (BST, Heap tree, AVL tree, Red Black tree, Syntax Tree)

    Why binary tree ?
        - Prerequisite for more advance trees like BST, AVL
        - Huffman coding problem, heap priority problem and expression parsing problem can be solved effectively
